# Module 14: The Belly Button Challenge
For this module, we had to read in a json file using the d3 libary in Javascript. The real challenge was trying to make the dropdown menu and other html components for the website.
I had a lot of help from my tutor, David Chao. He helped me understand how to select options and show the information, while simultaneously deleting the previous information after selecting a new option.
I've included multiple notes in the actual Javascript file, both for the convenience of the person reading my code and for me to remember what each line does when I'm studying it in the future.
